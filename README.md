`template-var` (`config/blocks/template-var.xml`) is not a standalone block —
it's a child type used by `block--content-html-template`'s `template_vars`
sub-block and isn't selectable on its own.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2+
- Symfony 7.0+
- Sulu CMS 3.0+
- `depa/sulu-block-helper`

## Installation

Both `depa/sulu-block-content` and `depa/sulu-block-helper` are proprietary
packages, not published on Packagist. Add them as VCS repositories in your
project's `composer.json` first:

```json
"repositories": [
    {"type": "vcs", "url": "https://github.com/depa-berlin/sulu-block-content.git"},
    {"type": "vcs", "url": "https://github.com/depa-berlin/sulu-block-helper.git"}
]
```

Then:

```bash
composer require depa/sulu-block-content:dev-main
```

If your project uses **Symfony Flex** (the default in the Sulu/Symfony
skeleton), both bundles are registered in `config/bundles.php` automatically —
skip the next step. Adding them manually on top would create a duplicate
registration.

Without Symfony Flex, register both bundles manually in `config/bundles.php`:

```php
Depa\SuluBlockHelperBundle\SuluBlockHelperBundle::class => ['all' => true],
Depa\SuluBlockContentBundle\SuluBlockContentBundle::class => ['all' => true],
```

### Optional: `block--content-form`

This one block additionally requires **`sulu/form-bundle`** (it provides the
`single_form_selection` field type and the `sulu_form_build()` Twig function
used by this block only — no other block needs it):

```bash
composer require sulu/form-bundle
```

Without it, this specific block fails: the field type is unknown in the admin
and rendering the block throws `Unknown "sulu_form_build" function`.

By default the block renders with SuluFormBundle's own theme
(`@SuluForm/themes/basic.html.twig`), so it works out of the box once the
bundle above is installed. If you enable the block's "Floating labels" option,
you must also supply your own `templates/form/floating-theme.html.twig` in
the consuming project — this is a project-specific design variant that is not
shipped by either bundle.
